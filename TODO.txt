TODO:
- When updating number of colors on table 1, save currently selected colors.

- Table 2 cell will change colors and contain index while the right side of table 1 will also add the index of the cell.

- Print will still be black and white but will now include table 1 with indeces.

- Set up database for colors with ID (PK, users will not interact with), Color Name, Hex Value
- User will be able to update color name and value
- Table 1 will have a size of n instead of 10. (Will still preinitialize to 10)
- Bonus points if user can change color name and hex at the same time.

GRADING BREAKDOWN:
- Ability to paint with a chosen color, coordinate appears in table when painted (10 points)
- Cells change colors when drop down changed (10 points)
- Print view shows coordinates, no colored-in cells (10 points)
- DB Access Page (10 Points)
- DB table added to store colors, application pulls from table to populate drop downs (5 points)
- User interface to add Colors (10) Points
- User interface to delete colors (10 points)
- User Interface to edit colors (5 points)
- Final Polish, app is a well-polished, good looking, application without errors (30 points)
   - This is a large category and basically will be an overall impression of your site.  
   - Most of the submissions to Milestone 1 would have received 15-20 points on this (so don't stress too much!).
   - Features that aren't implemented won't count against, but if something is implemented, it should work nicely.
